# üìä Student Performance Project

This project is a full-cycle Machine Learning application designed to **predict student performance** using both linear and polynomial models. Beyond just training models, it showcases **modular code design, experiment tracking, MLOps practices, containerization, cloud deployment, and demo hosting**.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

The goal was simple but ambitious: take raw student performance data and build a scalable, production-ready ML system that can predict outcomes, track experiments, and deploy models in real-world environments.

## üèó Phases of the Project

| Phase                               | Description                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Model Development**            | Trained **Linear Regression** and **Polynomial Regression** models. Modularized code into separate scripts, with `train.py` for training and comparing results against Jupyter Notebooks. |
| **2. Data & Experiment Management** | Versioned datasets using **DVC**, tracked experiments with **MLflow** for easy comparison of model performance and metrics.                                                               |
| **3. API Development**              | Built a **Flask API** to serve predictions. Integrated **DVC and MLflow** into the API to handle data and model versions dynamically.                                                     |
| **4. Containerization**             | Containerized the application using **Docker**, pushed images to **DockerHub**. Tested CI/CD workflows with **GitHub Actions** to ensure builds run smoothly.                             |
| **5. Cloud Deployment**             | Pushed Docker images from DockerHub to **AWS ECR** using IAM roles. Deployed to **AWS ECS** with cluster, task definition, and service setup. Accessed API via **EC2** instances.         |
| **6. Model Registry & Demo**        | Registered models with **AWS SageMaker Model Registry** for version control. Deployed a **demo on Hugging Face Spaces** for interactive testing.                                          |
